PowerShell code that prompts the user to input the link to the GitHub repository
This code uses the Read-Host command to prompt the user to enter the URL of the GitHub repository, and then stores the URL in the $repoUrl variable. The rest of the code remains unchanged. The cloned repository, the downloaded files, and the extracted files will all be located in a folder named after the repository.
